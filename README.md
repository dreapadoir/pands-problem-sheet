## Introduction
This repository will contain the commits for the weekly tasks on 52167 Programming and Scripting.


## Week 5
Create a program that returns whether today is a weekday or the weekend.

## Solution
[weekday.py](weekday.py)

I used the strftime method from the datetime module to assign the actual weekday to the variable day.
